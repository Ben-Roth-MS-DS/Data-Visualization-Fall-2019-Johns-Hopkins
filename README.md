Classwork from AS.470.673.81.FA19 Data Visualization, Fall 2019 JHU AAP

This repository contains my final portfolio and work for Data Visualization. The final portfolio consists of  campaign data from the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary. Most of the data I use is from the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), and consists of campaign contributions and campaign spending. I also used polling data aggregated by 538. Initially, I had included data ranging from January 1, 2017 to September 20, 2019 (the day before I downloaded the data). After looking at the data, however, I decided to change the date range to January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019. Not many observations occurred before 2019, and the data appeared incomplete past June. I break up my 11 graphs into 4 sections:

1. Disbursements

2. Contributions

3. Disbursement and Contribution Comparison

4. Polling

The visualizations were initially created in R in the file: Data-Viz-Complete-Graph-Creation.Rmd. Next, the graphs were editted using Adobe Illustrator to add additional information to and touch up the graphs. The final graphs with accompanying insights can be found in the file: Data-Viz-Complete-Graph-Creation.Rmd.

The final portfolio can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ben-Roth-MS-Data-Science/Data-Visualization-Fall-2019-Johns-Hopkins/Project/Data-Viz-Final-Presenation-Ben-Roth.html).
